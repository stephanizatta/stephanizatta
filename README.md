Full Stack Developer | Passionate about Problem-Solving and Scalable Solutions

I am a skilled Full Stack Developer with hands-on experience in a variety of technologies, including .NET, React, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, Cobol, HTML, CSS, and both relational and non-relational databases. I have developed a strong foundation in VSCode, Visual Studio, MySQL Workbench, MongoDB, and Postman.

My expertise also extends to working with version control (Git), Azure DevOps, and API integration. I have experience using tools like Datadog for monitoring, and I am familiar with technologies such as Firebase, JQuery, and Jest for testing.

I am committed to continuous learning and improvement, with a focus on optimizing both user experience and software performance. I thrive in agile environments and enjoy collaborating with teams to deliver high-quality solutions.
